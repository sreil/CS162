Rules:
1. If an occupied cell has zero or one neighbor, it dies of loneliness.
2. If an occupied cell has more than three neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.
3. If an empty cell has exactly three occupied neighbor cells, there is a birth of a new cell
to replace the empty cell.
4. Births and deaths are instantaneous and occur at the changes of generation.
